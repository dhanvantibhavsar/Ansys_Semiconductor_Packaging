## 📋 Theory: Semiconductor Testing at Different Stages

Semiconductor devices undergo testing throughout various stages of the manufacturing process to ensure performance, reliability, and functionality. Testing is conducted at both the **Foundry** and **OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test)** levels.

---

## 🏭 Foundry Testing Stages

### 1. Front-End Manufacturing
- Involves wafer fabrication and creation of integrated circuits on silicon wafers.
- **Process development** ensures quality control and high-yield production.

### 2. Wafer Probe Test
- Electrical testing of individual dies on the wafer before dicing.
- Identifies and marks non-functional dies.

### 3. Wafer Sorting
- Dies are sorted based on probe test results.
- Only functional dies proceed to packaging.

---

## 🏗️ OSAT Testing Stages

### 1. Package Manufacturing
- Functional dies are packaged using techniques like:
  - Die bonding
  - Wire or flip-chip bonding
  - Encapsulation
- Continues **process development** to optimize packaging.

### 2. Package Testing
- Conducted in ISO Class 6/7 cleanroom zones.
- Testing includes:
  - **AOST (Assembly Open and Short Test)**: Quick check for opens/shorts.
  - **Burn-in**: Applies voltage and temperature stress to catch early failures.
  - **Final Test**: Functional and parametric testing across temperature ranges.

## 🧪 Assembly Open and Short Test (AOST)

**Objective:** Quickly detect shorts or opens on package leads or balls.

- Performed after **Trim and Form** or **Singulation** processes.
- Includes:
  - Electrical tests to detect major failures.
  - Vision inspection for visible defects (e.g., missing leads, damaged balls).
- Uses **Product Grade Sort (PGSRT)** to classify into:
  - Best (1)
  - Better (2)
  - Better (3)
  - Scrap (4)

### Common Defects Detected
- Head on Pillow (HoP)
- Non Wet Open (NWO)
- Bridging
- Die Cracks
- Warpage (Concave/Convex)

## 🧠 Summary

Testing at multiple stages ensures:
- Early detection and correction of defects.
- Improved yield and product reliability.
- Better customer satisfaction and lower field failure rates.

# 📦 IC Testing Procedures – Burn-in, Final Test, and ATE Overview

This document provides an overview of various stages involved in the testing of integrated circuits (ICs), focusing on **Burn-in Testing**, **Final Testing**, and the use of **Automatic Test Equipment (ATE)**.

---

## 🔥 Burn-in Test

**Objective:**  
To test package components under elevated (stressful) conditions like **temperature**, **voltage**, and **power cycling** to screen out early failures (infant mortality).

### Key Points:
- Identifies **Infant Mortality Failures** before components reach customers.
- Parts are loaded onto **Burn-in boards**, then placed into ovens (Burn-in system).
- Failures are accelerated using **high voltage** and **high temperature** stress.
- The test duration is enough to capture initial failure rates and beyond the curve flattening point.
- Common failures detected include:
  - **Dielectric breakdown**
  - **Metallization faults**
  - **Electromigration**
- Burn-in improves reliability by eliminating weak components but may slightly **reduce total lifespan**.

## ✅ Final Test

**Objective:**  
To verify that the packaged product meets electrical and thermal specifications across corner cases.

### Process:
- Performed using handlers with **temperature-controlled fixtures**, not ovens.
- **Hot Test:** High temperature electrical verification as per datasheet specs.
- **Cold Test:** Low temperature electrical testing.

Example device: `LM741 OPAMP`

## 🧪 Summary: ATE & Test Categories

### Automatic Test Equipment (ATE)

ATE is responsible for sending automated test patterns to the Device Under Test (DUT).

### Categories of ATE Tests:
- **Parametric Tests**: Measures current/voltage to check if circuits operate within limits.
- **Functional Tests**: Validates if the IC performs correctly under normal conditions.
- **Speed Tests**: Measures processing speed; parts are sorted accordingly.

### Key Performance Indicators:
- **Yield**
- **Testing Time**
- **Test Coverage**

### Equipment Examples:
- **In-Circuit Tester (ICT)**
- **COBOT (Collaborative Robot)**
- **Handler Units**
- **Teradyne Test Station**
